In one of the most intriguing moves in
modem corporate history, Jack Tramiel,
the most successful consumer computer
manufacturer, recently left Commodore,
the company he had founded, and
bought Atari, one of his biggest victims
in the billion-dollar battle for the personal computer dollar.
A survivor of the Nazi Holocaust,
Tramiel had taken a tiny typewriter parts
company and built it into a major
American corporation. In the process, he
became a modem corporate legend.
Some of his vice presidents thought he
was a saint; some thought he had the
world 's hardest heart. But few deny the
brilliance of this complex entrepreneur.
For the past four years, Michael
Tomczyk was Trarniel's assistant.
Throughout Commodore's explosive rise
to leadership in the computer field,
Tomczyk was a close insider. Most importantl y, Tomczyk is a keen observer,
and his book takes the reader into a
vivid, dramatic world where a powerful,
brilliant businessman almos t singlehandedly fashions the American consumer computer industry.
It was a titanic strugg le, a twofront war. Conflict raged inside Commodore, as careers rose and fell.
